# Decentralized Supply Chain Visibility & Traceability Network

A blockchain-based system for transparent and verifiable supply chain management, enabling end-to-end product tracking, origin verification, and quality assurance across global supply networks.

## Overview

This decentralized network provides comprehensive supply chain visibility through five core components:

- **Coordinator Verification System**: Validates and manages supply chain coordinators
- **Product Tracking System**: Real-time product movement and location tracking
- **Origin Verification System**: Authenticates product sources and manufacturing details
- **Quality Assurance System**: Monitors and validates product quality standards
- **Transparency Reporting System**: Generates comprehensive supply chain reports

## Key Features

### üîê Coordinator Management
- Secure coordinator registration and verification
- Role-based access control
- Reputation scoring system
- Multi-signature coordinator operations

### üì¶ Product Tracking
- Unique product identification
- Real-time location updates
- Movement history logging
- Batch and individual item tracking

### üè≠ Origin Verification
- Manufacturing source validation
- Raw material provenance
- Certification tracking
- Compliance verification

### ‚úÖ Quality Assurance
- Quality checkpoint validation
- Test result recording
- Standards compliance monitoring
- Defect tracking and reporting

### üìä Transparency Reporting
- Supply chain analytics
- Stakeholder reporting
- Public transparency dashboards
- Audit trail generation

## Architecture

The system is built on a decentralized blockchain network using Clarity smart programming language, ensuring:

- **Immutable Records**: All supply chain data is permanently recorded
- **Transparency**: Public verification of supply chain claims
- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure or control
- **Interoperability**: Compatible with existing supply chain systems

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Clarinet CLI tool
- Node.js 18+
- Stacks wallet for testing

### Installation

\`\`\`bash
\# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd supply-chain-traceability

\# Install dependencies
npm install

\# Run tests
npm test

\# Deploy to testnet
clarinet deploy --testnet
\`\`\`

### Configuration

1. Configure your coordinator credentials
2. Set up product categories and standards
3. Define quality checkpoints
4. Configure reporting parameters

## Usage

### For Supply Chain Coordinators

1. **Register as Coordinator**
    - Submit verification documents
    - Complete identity validation
    - Receive coordinator credentials

2. **Track Products**
    - Register new products
    - Update product locations
    - Record quality checkpoints

3. **Verify Origins**
    - Submit origin certificates
    - Validate manufacturing details
    - Update compliance status

### For Consumers and Stakeholders

1. **Track Product Journey**
    - Scan product QR codes
    - View complete movement history
    - Access quality reports

2. **Verify Authenticity**
    - Check origin certificates
    - Validate quality standards
    - Review compliance records

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests using Vitest:

\`\`\`bash
\# Run all tests
npm test

\# Run specific test suite
npm test -- coordinator
npm test -- product-tracking
npm test -- quality-assurance

\# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
\`\`\`

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Implement your changes
4. Add comprehensive tests
5. Submit a pull request

## Security Considerations

- All coordinator actions require proper authentication
- Product data is cryptographically signed
- Quality reports are immutable once recorded
- Access controls prevent unauthorized modifications

## Roadmap

- [ ] Mobile app integration
- [ ] IoT sensor integration
- [ ] AI-powered quality prediction
- [ ] Multi-chain interoperability
- [ ] Enterprise API gateway
